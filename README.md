# 🔐 Python Random Password Generator

## 📝 Description
A customizable and secure password generator built with Python. Unlike simple generators, this tool puts **you** in control. You specify exactly how many letters, numbers, and symbols you want, and the script generates a completely randomized password based on your criteria.

## ✨ Features
* **User Input:** You decide the exact composition of your password.
* **Character Variety:**
  * Uses upper and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z).
  * Uses digits (0-9).
  * Uses a wide range of special symbols (!, #, $, %, etc.).
* **Randomized Output:** The script uses `random.shuffle` to ensure the characters are mixed thoroughly, making the password harder to guess.

## 🚀 How to Run
